# ph-jdmc

Status: **work in progress**

Java Domain Model Creator (jdmc).
The source structure is defined in JSON, and the domain model, test classes and XML serialization for usage on the "ph-" stack is created.
See the `ph-jdmc-example` subproject which is purely created by the unit tests of `ph-jdmc-core`.

The `ph-jdmc-maven-plugin` subproject is a Maven plugin to use JDMC in your projects.
